                I welcome you to my personal webpage. In this page I would like to
                introduce myself in terms of my education, experience and skills. 
                <br /><br />
                I consider myself to be a hardware engineer i.e. the person that develops
                electronics that have the potential to change the life of billions of
                people. 
                <br /><br />
